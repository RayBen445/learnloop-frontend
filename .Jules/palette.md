## 2026-01-29 - Context-Aware Action Buttons
**Learning:** Generic labels like "Upvote" or just numbers on icon-only buttons are insufficient for screen readers, especially when the action toggles (Upvote/Remove vote). Adding context like "Upvote post" and current state "Current count: 5" significantly improves the non-visual experience.
**Action:** Always verify if an action button has a toggled state and if the label clearly communicates the *outcome* of clicking it (e.g., "Remove vote" vs "Upvote") rather than just describing the icon.
